# PyBer Analysis

## Overview PyBer Analyis
The goal of this analsysi was to analyze the different costs of ridesharing fares by city types. The three different city types that were analyzed were Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. The end goal was to see how much people spend on rideshares in those cities and if that spending changes during different months of the year.  

## Results: 
After analyzing the PyBer data it is clear that people spend much more money on ridesharing in Urban communites than Subiurban or Rural communities. Suburbuban communities have the second highest fares and Rural have the third highest fares. This makes logical sense as more people tend to live in Urban areas than Suburban or Rural areas. The line graph showing the total number of fares per week for January thru April for the three city types can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Total_Fares.png).
One interesting note is that Rural riders have the highest average fares and drivers make the most money per ride compared to the other two city types. This can be seen in the output of lines 6 and 7 of the code [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer.ipynb). This also makes logical sense because places tend to be more spread out in Rural areas so one would expect to pay more for a ride compared to an Urban or Suburban area. 


## Summary
The three reccommendation I would make to the CEO of PyBer would be to continue to increase your drivers in the Urban areas, make sure there are enough drivers in the Rural areas without over hiring in those areas, and make sure to be fully hired during the busiest times of the year. The reason I would focus mainly on Urban areas is that tey account for a large portion of the fares and profits of the company. I would still have focus on the Rural areas because the price per ride is the highest there, so PyBer and the drivers can make good profits in those areas. Lastly, as can be seen in the line graph, rides tend to increase during the busier times of the year. So I would suggest that PyBer stays informed on all local events of when to have the neccessary drivers hired.
